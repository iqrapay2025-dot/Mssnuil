and common mistakes in prayer. Suitable for beginners and anyone 
wanting to improve their prayer. Compiled by the MSSN Da'wah Committee 
in collaboration with UNILORIN Islamic scholars.

2. Keep descriptions consistent
3. Archive old/outdated content
4. Test all links before publishing
5. Update reports annually

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Link doesn't work when clicked"
**Solutions:**
- Make sure sharing settings are "Anyone with link"
- Check that the file wasn't deleted from cloud storage
- Try the link in an incognito/private browser window

### Problem: "File takes too long to load"
**Solutions:**
- Large files are expected to load slowly
- Mention the file size in the description

### Problem: "Students can't download the file"
**Solutions:**
- Check Google Drive sharing settings
- Ensure permission is set to "Viewer" (allows download)

### Problem: "Video is blocked or unavailable"
**Solutions:**
- Check YouTube video privacy settings
- Make sure video isn't age-restricted
- Verify the video didn't violate YouTube policies
- Consider using alternative platforms like Vimeo

### Problem: "Can't find uploaded resource on website"
