## Troubleshooting

### "My data disappeared!"

**Possible causes:**

   - Check browser settings for auto-clear options

2. **Different browser**
   - Data is browser-specific
   - Use the same browser you uploaded content in

3. **Incognito/Private mode**
   - Private browsing doesn't save localStorage
   - Use normal browsing mode

4. **Different device**
   - localStorage is device + browser specific
   - Data won't sync across devices

### "How do I backup my data?"

1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Click each key and copy the JSON
4. Paste into a text file
5. Save as `mssn-backup-[date].json`

### "How do I restore from backup?"

1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Paste this code (replace with your data):
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('mssnBlogPosts', '[your JSON data here]');
localStorage.setItem('newsletters', '[your JSON data here]');
// Repeat for each key
```
4. Reload the page
